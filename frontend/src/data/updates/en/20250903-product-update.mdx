# 2025-09-03 Update Notes

## Improvements
- Unified the Updates page with the landing page visual style and interactions
- Improved Chinese copy in selected pages for better readability
- Fixed missing default values for calculation parameters when creating new nodes
- Resolved React warnings caused by recreating `edgeTypes` / `nodeTypes` on each render
- Fixed edge double-click editing for flow rate
- Optimized time-step storage strategy and improved API performance for result tables

Tip: A flowchart needs at least one influent or effluent node to run calculations.
