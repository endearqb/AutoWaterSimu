# v0.1.0 Beta Release

This beta release brings the first end-to-end experience for learning, modeling, simulation, and analysis in wastewater treatment.

## Highlights
- Landing page and core navigation for the ENVDAMA platform
- Knowledge hub (AI Deep Research) entry
- Flowchart modeling workflow (build → configure → simulate → review results)
- Interactive calculators for common water-quality indices
- Updates page to track platform changes

## Getting Started
- Create an account and sign in to access simulation jobs
- Build a flowchart by dragging nodes onto the canvas and connecting edges
- Configure parameters in the inspector panel, then run a simulation
- Review results in tables and panels after the job completes

Note: Some detailed guides and screenshots are currently available only in Chinese.
